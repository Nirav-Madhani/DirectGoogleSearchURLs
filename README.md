# DirectGoogleSearchURLs
Remove Intermediate Google Tracking

## What Does It Do?
`When ever you click a **search reasult** from google search, it uses **an itermediate URL** to redirect you to target site.`

Although, above fact is generally well known here is a small demonstration to expain.

When you hover on Result, it does show target website at bottom left.

You will see a very long URL as shown above.

My extension helps to remove, such intermediate URLs
