# DirectGoogleSearchURLs
Remove Intermediate Google Tracking Using TamperMonkey Script

## What Does It Do?
When ever you click a **search reasult** from google search, it uses **an itermediate URL** to redirect you to target site.

#### Before/After Demo

![GoogleDirectURL](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77914957/116587900-89cb5900-a938-11eb-8126-d36ed8116367.gif)

As you can see, before enabling script we were being redirected throud intermediate URL, but after enabling script, the intermediate URL vanished.
